    <h1>Rivals of Aether</h1>
    <p>Rivals of aether is one of the best 2D platform fighter games there is. What a 2D platform fighter is is pretty much a game where you and a opponent pick a character. Then the goal is to hurt the opponent as much as possible with diffrent attacks and signature moves until they die 3 times.
    </p>

    <p>Rivals might not be as big as other figter games due to it costing a fair amount of money on steam but its 100% worth it i can tell you. The tutorials are great and helpful and there is always helpful websites like this one to support every beginner.</p>

    <p>The thing about rivals is that. There isnt many characters in comparison to other fighter games. Which in my opinion in is a good thing because every character is very unique in its own way and playstyle and can be used in tournaments.</p>

    <p>There are three diffrent elements of characters in rivals. Fire, Earth, Water, Air and they all have something in common. For example is Sylvanos a earth elemental together with kragg and maypul. All of their gameplay has something to do with ground control and spacing. Meanwhile fire rivals often depend on some moves that are way stronger than the rest of their options. And air elementals always try to take control of aerial combat and spacing.</p>
