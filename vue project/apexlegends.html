        <div class="imagetext">
            <p>Apex legends is a battle royale shooter which means that you / your squad face other people where you jump down in an open world and loot guns and gear of the ground to achieve easier victory against the other 100 players.</p>

            <p>Battle royales are one of the most common shooters nowdays and for good reason. Some people just prefer to find guns of the ground or packages instead of always keeping your head on economy such as counter strike.</p>

            <p>Some people also prefer just too always find new opponents and making the chance of winning just more harder overall. But apex also has alot of diffrent characters just like Valorant with unique abillities and ultimates to better execute / defend your attacks and achive victory.</p>
