        <h1>Counter Strike</h1>
        <div class="imagetext">
            <p>Counterstrike is one of the most oldest and classic shooters out there it came it to being as early as 2003. But its updated and more quality game of it Global Offensive came into being in 2012. CS as you often shortern it, is the most iconic tactical shooter out there and is a tactical shooter. Which means you need to play with pistols / shotguns and work your way with your economy to afford more quality guns to defeat your opponent with. The main game is to play as a terrorist or counter terrorist and the terrorists will attack and plant a bomb on one of two sites and the counter terrorists will try and avoid them from doing so and in the worst case try and defuse the planted bomb.</p>

            <p>The team who wins the most amount of rounds from pistol to rifle wins the game.</p>

            <p>Counter strike is a very fun shooter game with very retro mechanics and enjoyable with multiple friends in ranked or casual. It also lead into some new mordern tactical shooters such as Valorant.</p>

            <p>only big downside to it is the anti cheat as well as matchmaking. Alot of people cheat and since its free to play and Valve has not really done anything with their anti cheat for years and now even requires players to look at gameplay of others (overwatch) to tell if a person is cheating its a clear sign that something needs to be done about it but valve simply does not.</p>

            <p>The matchmaking is also horrible especially if you play free to play you will often get lack luster teamates who does not want to coordinate and enemies who will cheat etc. But overall fun game 6/10
