        <h1>Elden Ring</h1>
        <div class="imagetext">
            <p>Elden ring is a open world action boss and was one of the most well awaited games that ever came out. Its
                very popular and its mechanics to fight against bosses and enemies are just outstanding coming from the
                community.</p>
                
               <p>It is a game that you can take on your own and aswell very interesting to watch as a non
                player. It is very simular to the game Darksouls III where its a non open world but still simular to
                Elden ring but overall less exploring. But adding all of that and the open world and amazing graphics
                makes Elden ring the best of the best games available on steam even for its pricetag of 50â‚¬ it easily
                makes up for it. The game requires knowledge and attack patterns in order to preform well and enjoy it
                even further. 10/10!</p>
